# COUTILS :hammer: :gear:

![GitHub CI](https://github.com/angeldollface/coutils/actions/workflows/rust.yml/badge.svg)

***A set of useful functions for Rust. :hammer: :gear:***

## ABOUT :books:

I found myself re-writing the same functions a million times in different Rust projects. Because this is not efficient and is quite time-consuming, I thought I'd unify these common functions into a library. This is that library. ***Coutils*** is short for ***Co***mmon ***Utilities***. Enjoy. :heart:

## INSTALLATION :inbox_tray:

To use ***Coutils*** in your Rust project, add this line to your project's `Cargo.toml`'s `[dependencies]` section:

```TOML
coutils = { git = "https://github.com/angeldollface/coutils", version = "1.2.0" }
```

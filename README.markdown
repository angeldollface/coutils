# COUTILS

![GitHub CI](https://github.com/angeldollface/coutils/actions/workflows/rust.yml/badge.svg)

***A set of useful functions for Rust.***

## ABOUT

I found myself re-writing the same functions a million times in different Rust projects. Because this is not efficient and is quite time-consuming, I thought I'd unify these common functions into a library. This is that library. ***Coutils*** is short for ***Co***mmon ***Utilities***. Enjoy. :heart:

## INSTALLATION

To use ***Coutils*** in your Rust project, add this line to your project's `Cargo.toml`'s `[dependencies]` section:

```TOML
coutils = "1.3.0"
```

## USAGE

To check out this crate's API, please visit the [documentation page](https://docs.rs/coutils/1.3.0).
